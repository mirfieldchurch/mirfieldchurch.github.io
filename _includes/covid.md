# Coronavirus Update
 
 We are re-opening the church building for morning services in person from ***Sunday 13th September at 10.45am***. Due to social distancing regulations, we are required to limit numbers attending. If you would like to pre-book a place to attend, please email [mirfieldchurch@gmail.com](mailto:mirfieldchurch@gmail.com) by 5pm on the Friday before the service you are hoping to attend. All those attending ***must wear a face-covering***, in line with government regulations, unless you have an exemption for health or age reasons.
 
For those unable to attend in person, we will be live-streaming the morning service via our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu--nNMXknJlTP39UKE1tng)
 
Evening services and other activities will continue to take place via Zoom. Contact the church on the above email address for more details.
 
If you are in need of any support, whether practically, emotionally, or spiritually, please donâ€™t hesitate to be in touch.
